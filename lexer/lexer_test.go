/*
Description: Go test function for a lexer package
During the test, each token produced by the lexer is compared against expected values.
If the actual type or literal does not match the expected ones,
the test will fail, indicating that thereâ€™s an issue with the lexer implementation.
This approach helps ensure that the lexer behaves as intended and can accurately parse the input into tokens.
